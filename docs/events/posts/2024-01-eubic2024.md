The EuBIC-MS Winter School is organized each second year by the European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry (EuBIC-MS), an initiative of the European Proteomics Association (EuPA) for user-oriented bioinformatics for mass spectrometry-based omics.

The Winter School starts with an educational day dedicated to workshops and training in established computation MS tools and workflows. The following days, internationally renowned invited speakers give lectures and practical workshops covering the aspects of identification, quantification, result interpretation, and integration of MS data.
