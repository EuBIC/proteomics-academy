  Single-cell -omics, particularly RNA sequencing, has transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, but traditional methods lack the ability to capture a cellâ€™s complete molecular profile. Recent breakthroughs in single-cell mass spectrometry now allow in-depth analysis of the proteome, lipidome, and metabolome, making it a rapidly growing field. The conference will unite experts from academia and industry to discuss new technologies and applications, fostering collaboration to advance our understanding of cellular biology and drive innovations in medicine.
