Proteomics Academy is an educational resource for scientists wanting to exchange on Proteomics. It is a joint effort of the [European Proteomics Association (EuPA)][eupa] educational committee and the [European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry (EuBIC-MS)][eubic] to foster exchange of knowledge on proteomics.

The website and its different components are under constant improvement. Feel free to explore, share your ideas, and contact us if you want to contribute!
